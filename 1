1.	Research work on the topic of the dissertation (research proposal, as well as the primary literature review on the topic of the dissertation with the original, beginning, list of references). 
This research focuses on the development of an integrated AI-driven information system for interpreting geospatial image data to address complex challenges. By leveraging advanced machine learning techniques such as convolutional neural networks (CNNs) and semantic segmentation models, the study aims to automate the extraction and analysis of features from satellite imagery, drone-captured data, and aerial photographs. The integration of geospatial tools and AI enables accurate mapping, real-time monitoring, and data-driven decision-making. The research also explores methods for optimizing data preprocessing, model training, and geospatial visualization to enhance the efficiency and accuracy of geospatial data interpretation. This dissertation contributes to the theoretical foundations of AI in geospatial analytics and offers practical solutions for real-world applications.

Relevance of the research topic: Geospatial Artificial Intelligence (GeoAI) is an interdisciplinary field that integrates geospatial data and artificial intelligence techniques to address complex spatial problems. By leveraging advancements in machine learning, deep learning, and data visualization we can unlock new possibilities for uncovering patterns, predicting trends, analyzing, visualizing, and interpreting geospatial information across various sectors.
These sectors are Urban Planning and Smart Cities, Agriculture and Precision Farming, Disaster Management, Transportation and Logistics. 
The relevance of Geospatial Artificial Intelligence lies in its ability to address global challenges such as urbanization, climate change, disaster management, and resource optimization. 
Cartography: Automating the labeling of maps based on natural language descriptions.
Remote Sensing: Annotating satellite images by describing features detected 
Environmental Planning: Identify areas suitable for solar farms based on weather data and land availability.
Agriculture: Recommend crop planting strategies based on soil data and rainfall predictions.
Disaster Management: Generating evacuation plans by analyzing flood zones.

Purpose of the work:
The sector that this research will focus on is AI in geospatial image analysis, such as satellite, aerial, and drone images. Specifically, the research will focus on processes such as Object Classification, Object Detection, Pixel Classification, Instance Segmentation, Edge Detection, Road Extraction. The purpose is to efficiently process vast amounts of visual data, enabling precise extraction of spatial features and insights for diverse applications. These data provide only a roof view of target objects, and the area coverage is large, but the objects are usually small. Therefore, the available information of objects is limited, not to mention issues of rotation, scale, complex background, and object-background occlusions.

Research Objectives:	
This research aims to develop a system that integrates object detection, object classification, edge detection, road extraction techniques into a unified integrated framework. Additionally, it aims to develop a system that utilizes multi modal data such as spatial coordinates, raster, and vector data. Design a model capable to generalize across diverse geographies, seasons, and environmental conditions.
Object of the research: The objective of this research is to develop an advanced information system powered by artificial intelligence for the interpretation of geospatial image data. The system aims to address the challenges of extracting meaningful insights from large-scale geospatial datasets by leveraging state-of-the-art machine learning models and deep learning models, such as convolutional neural networks (CNNs), for image analysis and feature extraction. By integrating AI with geospatial tools, the research seeks to solve tasks such as object detection, object classification, edge detection, road extraction. 

Subject of research: The subject of this research revolves around the application of artificial intelligence (AI) in interpreting and analyzing geospatial image data. It focuses on exploring how AI techniques, particularly machine learning and deep learning, can be utilized to extract valuable information from complex geospatial datasets, such as satellite imagery, aerial photographs, and drone-captured images. The research also examines the integration of geospatial analytics with AI models to address real-world challenges in areas like environmental monitoring, disaster management, urban development, and resource planning.

Methods of research: 
The research employs a combination of qualitative and quantitative methods to develop and validate an AI-powered system for geospatial image interpretation. The key methods include:
Data Collection and Preprocessing: Geospatial datasets such as satellite imagery, drone-captured images, and aerial photographs are collected from sources like Sentinel, Landsat, and local mapping agencies. Preprocessing techniques, including georeferencing, atmospheric correction, normalization, and noise removal, are applied to prepare the data for analysis.
Algorithm Development: Advanced machine learning and deep learning techniques are employed, with a focus on models like Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) for image classification, U-Net or SegNet for semantic segmentation, and object detection frameworks like YOLO or Faster R-CNN. The models are trained and fine-tuned using labeled datasets.
Geospatial Integration: The study integrates AI models with geospatial tools and libraries such as GDAL, GeoPandas, and QGIS. This enables spatial analysis, mapping, and visualization of AI outputs within georeferenced systems.
System Implementation: A prototype information system is developed, combining a backend for data processing (using Python and TensorFlow/PyTorch) with a user-friendly frontend for data visualization (using web-based GIS tools like Leaflet or Mapbox).
Validation and Evaluation: The system's performance is evaluated using metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, and Intersection over Union (IoU). Ground truth data is used to validate AI predictions, and the results are compared with existing methods to assess the system's effectiveness.
Case Studies: Specific use cases, such as land use classification, disaster monitoring, or urban growth analysis, are conducted to demonstrate the system's applicability and practical relevance.

Theoretical and practical significance of the study:
Practical significance of artificial intelligence in geoscience comes from the fact that this technology can help analyze and communicate disaster-related geospatial data generating evacuation plans by analyzing flood zones or by summarizing areas affected by a natural disaster for first responders. It can enhance decision-making by interpreting geospatial data and suggesting actionable insights. For example, recommend crop planting strategies based on soil data and rainfall predictions. Additional practical applications include predictive analysis and risk assessment, like predicting flood risks based on historical spatial data and current weather trends or assessing wildfire risks in vulnerable regions. 
The theoretical significance of this research lies in advancing the understanding and application of artificial intelligence in geospatial data interpretation. By exploring innovative AI techniques, such as convolutional neural networks (CNNs) and semantic segmentation models, the study contributes to the growing body of knowledge in both machine learning and geospatial science. It provides insights into optimizing AI algorithms for processing large-scale geospatial datasets, addressing challenges like spatial resolution, data heterogeneity, and multi-temporal analysis. Furthermore, the research bridges the gap between AI and geospatial domains, offering a theoretical framework for integrating spatial analytics with intelligent systems. This foundation not only enhances the accuracy and efficiency of geospatial data interpretation but also serves as a basis for future studies aiming to expand the applications of AI in geospatial and environmental sciences.
